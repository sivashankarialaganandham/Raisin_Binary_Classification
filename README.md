# Raisin Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project focuses on the binary classification of raisins into two categories: Besni and Kecimen. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives
- Gain insight into the dataset and its features.
- Clean and preprocess the data for effective modelling.
- Conduct feature engineering.
- Apply logistic regression algorithms to differentiate between raisin varieties.
- Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters and emphasizing key features.
- Evaluate the performance of logistic regression against other classification algorithms.
  
## About the Dataset
The dataset comprises two varieties of raisins (Ke√ßimen and Besni) grown in Turkey. Images of these two raisin types were sourced using CVS. A total of 900 raisin grains were included in the dataset, with 450 samples from each variety. The images underwent multiple preprocessing steps, and seven morphological features were extracted for analysis.

- **Dataset**: Raisin Grain
- **Content**: Besni (0) and Kecimen (1)
- **Number of Rows**: 900
